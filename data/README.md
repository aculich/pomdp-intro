# Data files

Data files are organized relative to the appendix. Appendix A provides the simulation study results, Appendix B provides the analysis on the two fisheries selected from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Data.

- Note that the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Data is not provided in this directory, but is accessed directly from it's original source. Please see the R code in Appendix B.  

- While the `.policyx` files can be regenerated using the code provided in the appendices, this step is particularly time consuming and so these files are provided for convenience. The `.policyx` filename contains a hash of based on the parameters used to generate it; if present, the software will load this solution file in lieu of re-running the full algorithm.
